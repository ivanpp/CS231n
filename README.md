# CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This repository contains my solution for the cs231n of Stanford University.

It hasn't been finished yet. But i will keep going.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via e-mail(ding@ivanpp.me).

## Assignment1

- [x] implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (**kNN**) classifier
- [x] implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (**SVM**) classifier
- [x] implement and apply a **Softmax** classifier
- [ ] implement and apply a **Two layer neural network** classifier
- [ ] get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using **higher-level representations** than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)
