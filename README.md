# CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This repository contains my solution for the cs231n of Stanford University.

It hasn't been finished yet. But i will keep going.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via e-mail(ding@ivanpp.me).

## Assignment1

- [x] Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (20 points)

- [x] Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points)

- [x] Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points)

- [x] Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (25 points)

- [x] Bonus: Implement some extra techniques on Two-Layer Neural Network (5 points)
      see: `./Assignment1/cs231n/classifiers/neural_net.py` and  `./Assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb`
      I implement the dropconnect in `neural_net.py` and get 57.1% test accuracy in `two_layer_net.ipynb`

- [x] Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (10 points)

- [ ] Bonus: Design your own features!

- [ ] Q6: Cool Bonus: Do something extra! (+10 points)
      Implement, investigate or analyze something extra surrounding the topics in this assignment, and using the code you developed. For example, is there some other interesting question we could have asked? Is there any insightful visualization you can plot? Or anything fun to look at? Or maybe you can experiment with a spin on the loss function? If you try out something cool we’ll give you up to 10 extra points and may feature your results in the lecture.

## Assignment2

- [ ] Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (25 points)
- [ ] Q2: Batch Normalization (25 points)
- [ ] Q3: Dropout (10 points)
- [ ] Q4: Convolutional Networks (30 points)
- [ ] Q5: PyTorch / Tensorflow on CIFAR-10 (10 points)​
